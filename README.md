# 12MonkeysPlugin
A plugin that simply loads 12Monkeys into Spade.

This plugin doesn't do much, just create a few exporters (for the formats that 12monkeys can write.) Adding the 12monkeys jars (there are quite a few of them) onto Spade's classpath will automaticaly make the formats readable, with the latest commit in my fork.
